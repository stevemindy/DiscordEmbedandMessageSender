Making webhooks in discord is easy!

Make a server (or go to an existant server),

Go to the servers settings,

In the **APPS** section select Integrations,

Choose the button with the name of "**Webhooks**" and make a new webhook!

Copy the **Webhook URL**

After running the python programs you will be prompted to enter the webhook link.

Just copy it and everything else will from that point be understandable.



(Tip: to upload images using **MessageSender.py** put your own images into the (*images*) folder! After the program tells you to input the image, type the name of the image and the extention(.png, .jpg ...) )
